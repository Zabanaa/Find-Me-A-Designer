# Lunch Ramp 

Lunch Ramp is a Single Page Application built with Angular 1.x that will retrive a list
venues from the Foursquare API based on the search parameters submitted by the user.

I mainly built it to solidify and practice my Angular Skills (Form validation, routing, animation, REST services etc).

To add a bit more challenge, I decided to do it using the newest version of Javascript (ES6 at the time of writing).

Overall it was a fun experience, the app is available at this URL if you want to play
around with it. (Just to reiterate, this is a very very basic app, creating for the sole
purpose of learning the technology behind it)

Feel free to dig into the source code and if you see anything that can be improved or
that I've missed, just submit a PR and I'll happily look into it. 

Thanks for stopping by !
